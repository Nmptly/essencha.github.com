Amidst the fervor, fellow Stranger Things cast members have also been drawn into the fray. Gaten Matarazzo, who plays Dustin Henderson, responded to the controversy by urging fans
to reserve judgment until Schnapp provides an explanation. Matarazzo stated, "Let's not jump to conclusions. People make mistakes, and we should give Noah a chance to clarify."
On the other hand, Millie Bobby Brown, who portrays Eleven, remained silent on the matter, leaving fans speculating about her stance.
As the boycott gains momentum, it remains to be seen how the cast and crew will navigate this unexpected storm, and whether Schnapp's explanation
will be enough to quell the rising tide of discontent among fans.
